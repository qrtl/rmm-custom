This module provides the base settings/functions for auction users (participants) who
are not internal users, but expected to be able to access the backend functions:

- Adds auction seller groups (auction seller user and auction seller manager).
- Adds necessary ACL records to auction seller user.
- Extends some controller/http methods to enable the backend login as an auction user.
